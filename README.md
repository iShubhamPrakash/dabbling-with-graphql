# Dabbling with graphql

> This repository contains all the code that I wrote while learning graphQl. This was one of the skills which I desperately wanted to have under my belt. After dabbleing with it I liked it a lot and really enjoyed the learning journey. I have also shared the links to the resources which I used so that you can learn this amazing technology :) 

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. 

GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. It can even be deployed within an integrated development environment (IDE) known as GraphiQL. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call. 

Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.
